# Unit 11 Express Homework: Note Taker

## Description

Create an application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. This application will use an express backend and save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

* The application frontend has already been created, it's your job to build the backend and connect the two.

* The following HTML routes should be created:

  * GET `/notes` - Should return the `notes.html` file.

  * GET `*` - Should return the `index.html` file

* The application should have a `db.json` file on the backend that will be used to store and retrieve notes using the `fs` module.

* The following API routes should be created:

  * GET `/api/notes` - Should read the `db.json` file and return all saved notes as JSON.

  * POST `/api/notes` - Should recieve a new note to save on the request body, add it to the `db.json` file, and then return the new note to the client.

  * DELETE `/api/notes/:id` - Should recieve a query paramter containing the id of a note to delete. This means you'll need to find a way to give each note a unique `id` when it's saved. In order to delete a note, you'll need to read all notes from the `db.json` file, remove the note with the given `id` property, and then rewrite the notes to the `db.json` file.

## User Story

AS A user, I want to be able to write and save notes

I WANT to be able to delete notes I've written before

SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete

## Business Context

For users that need to keep track of a lot of information, it's easy to forget or be unable to recall something important. Being able to take persistent notes allows users to have written information available when needed.

## Acceptance Criteria

Application should allow users to create and save notes.

Application should allow users to view previously saved notes.

Application should allow users to delete previously saved notes.

## Commit Early and Often

One of the most important skills to master as a web developer is version control. Building the habit of committing via Git is important for two reasons:

* Your commit history is a signal to employers that you are actively working on projects and learning new skills.

* Your commit history allows you to revert your codebase in the event that you need to return to a previous state.

Follow these guidelines for committing:

* Make single-purpose commits for related changes to ensure a clean, manageable history. If you are fixing two issues, make two commits.

* Write descriptive, meaningful commit messages so that you and anyone else looking at your repository can easily understand its history.

* Don't commit half-done work, for the sake of your collaborators (and your future self!).

* Test your application before you commit to ensure functionality at every step in the development process.

We would like you to have well over 200 commits by graduation, so commit early and often!

## Submission on BCS

You are required to submit the following:

* The URL of the deployed application

* The URL of the GitHub repository

Manipulate the HTTP Vary header

## Installation

This is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) module available through the
[npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/). Installation is done using the
[`npm install` command](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-locally): 

```sh
$ npm install vary
```

## API

<!-- eslint-disable no-unused-vars -->

```js
var vary = require('vary')
```

### vary(res, field)

Adds the given header `field` to the `Vary` response header of `res`.
This can be a string of a single field, a string of a valid `Vary`
header, or an array of multiple fields.

This will append the header if not already listed, otherwise leaves
it listed in the current location.

<!-- eslint-disable no-undef -->

```js
// Append "Origin" to the Vary header of the response
vary(res, 'Origin')
```

### vary.append(header, field)

Adds the given header `field` to the `Vary` response header string `header`.
This can be a string of a single field, a string of a valid `Vary` header,
or an array of multiple fields.

This will append the header if not already listed, otherwise leaves
it listed in the current location. The new header string is returned.

<!-- eslint-disable no-undef -->

```js
// Get header string appending "Origin" to "Accept, User-Agent"
vary.append('Accept, User-Agent', 'Origin')
```

## Examples

### Updating the Vary header when content is based on it

```js
var http = require('http')
var vary = require('vary')

http.createServer(function onRequest (req, res) {
  // about to user-agent sniff
  vary(res, 'User-Agent')

  var ua = req.headers['user-agent'] || ''
  var isMobile = /mobi|android|touch|mini/i.test(ua)

  // serve site, depending on isMobile
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html')
  res.end('You are (probably) ' + (isMobile ? '' : 'not ') + 'a mobile user')
})
```

## Testing

```sh
$ npm test
```
